			<h2>Helpful Habits:</h2>
			<div class="content">
				<ol>
					<li> Read good books:</li>
					<p>Audio books and high quality podcasts are
						included in this. The main objective of this
						is to expose yourself to new high quality
						ideas and knowledge.</p>

					<li> Do not watch too much TV:</li>
					<p>Unfortunately this includes YouTube and
						social media, though I would exclude
						video tutorials form this.</p>

					<li> Invest do not gamble:</li>
					<p>This does not mean this not taking risks with your
						money but instead to invest in capital.</p>

					<li> Exercise and eating well:</li>
					<p>When in shops just do not buy unhealthy food
						and even walking is exercise. </p>

					<li> Sleep well & getting up early:</li>
					<p>Keep your alarm constant. Take naps as required. </p>

					<li> Have multiple streams of income:</li>
					<p>Try to keep these streams independent of each other. </p>

					<li> Overwhelming positivity:</li>
					<p>This is easiest when you have a positive
						framework to view the world with. </p>

					<li> Have good manners:</li>
					<p>People are generally more receptive
						towards good manners, so swear less. </p>

					<li> Seek feedback to improve:</li>
					<p>Get feedback from people especially
						if it is negative, in fact not spirit. </p>

					<li> Work longer hours:</li>
					<p>But stay productive, sitting around is not
						going to produce anything. </p>

					<li> Avoid negativity & volunteer:</li>
					<p>Positivity generally builds more than
						negativity. </p>
					<p>You feel better about yourself
						and society after volunteering. </p>

					<li> Help others to succeed:</li>
					<p>Help, do not do everything. </p>

					<li> Set goals: </li>
					<p>Set goals or at minimum a broad general 
						direction to move towards.</p>
